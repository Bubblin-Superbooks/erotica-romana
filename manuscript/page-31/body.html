  Gladly would share with me half of their hard fought renown,
Could I but grant them my bed for one single night, and its comfort,
  But the poor wretches are held stark in cold Orkian grip.
Therefore, ye living, rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet,
  Until cold Lethe anoints, captures your foot in its flight.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
