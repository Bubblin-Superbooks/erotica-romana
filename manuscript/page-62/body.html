Now, all intelligent men look upon me in kindness. They like to
  Form their own image of me, just as the poet has done.
Nor do the girls take offense when they see meâ€”by no means the matrons.
  None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.
Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)
  Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,
Nor shall your member grow weary until you've enjoyed the full dozen
  Artful positions the great poet Philainis describes.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
