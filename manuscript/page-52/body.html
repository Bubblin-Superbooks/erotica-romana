  Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain in the wind
Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching
  Blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day.
Quirites, permit me the joy, and may this, of all pleasures on earth the
  First and the last, be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
