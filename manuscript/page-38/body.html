Gazing into her eyes, holding hands, giving kisses, exchanging
  Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand,
Murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.
  Hymns of such sort pass away, wanting prosodical tact.
Goddess of morning, Aurora, as friend of my muse I once knew you.
  Has the unprincipled god, Cupid, seduced you now too?
So that these mornings you come as his sweetheart, awakening me at
  His festive altar again, where I must celebrate him?
Here on my breast flows her hair, an abundance of curls, while her head rests,
  Pressing my arm as it's bent, so as to pillow her neck.
What a delicious condition, if only these few tranquil moments
  Could in my memory fix firmly that image of joy
When the night rocked us to sleepâ€”but in slumber she's moving away now,
  From my side turns, as she goes leaving her hand in my hand.
Love in our hearts</blockquote></div> </div>
