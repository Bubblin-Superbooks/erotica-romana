  Far back there in the north, wrapped in a grayish light.
Over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy;
  Colorless, formless, that world round this exhausted man lay.
Seeking myself in myself, an unsatisfied spirit, I brooded,
  Spying out pathways dark, lost in dreary reflection.
Here in an �ther more clear now a luster encircles my forehead.
  Phoebus the god evokes forms, clear are his colors by day.
Bright with the stars comes the evening, ringing with songs that are tender,
  And the glow of the moon, brighter than northern sun.
What blessedness mortals may know! Am I now dreaming? Or welcomes
  Jupiter, Father, as guest—me, to ambrosial halls?
See, I lie here extending my arms toward your knees. I am praying:
  Hospitality's</blockquote></div> </div>
