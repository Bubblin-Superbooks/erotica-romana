<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vii</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>Happily now on classical soil I feel inspiration.
  Voices from present and past speak here evocatively.
Heeding ancient advice, I leaf through the works of the Ancients
  With an assiduous hand. Daily the pleasure's renewed.
Throughout the night, in a different way, I'm kept busy by Cupidâ€”
  If erudition is halved, rapture is doubled that way.
Do then I not become wise when I trace with my eye her sweet bosom's
  Form, and the line of her hips stroke with my hand? I acquire,
As I reflect and compare, my first understanding of marble,
  See with an eye that feels, feel with a hand that sees.
While my beloved, I grant it, deprives me of moments of daylight,
    She in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.
And we do more than just kiss; we prosecute reasoned discussions
  (Should she succumb to sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts).
