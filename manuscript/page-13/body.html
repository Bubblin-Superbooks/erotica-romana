Banquets and game tables, operas, balls, promenades down the Corso?
  These but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times.
Finery, haughtiness do not entice me. Does one not lift a
  Gown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool?
If she's to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom,
  Doesn't he want her to be free from all brooches and chains?
Must not the jewelry, and then the lace and the bustles and whalebone
  All of it come off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?
I encounter no troubles like those. Simple dress of rough homespun,
  At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles in folds to the floor.
Quickly he carries the girl as she's clad in chemise of coarse linenâ€”
  Just as a nursemaid might, playfully up to her bed.
Drapings of satin are absent; the mattress is quite unembroidered.
  Large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two.
