  Yes, he will offer you girlsâ€”if like a fool you despise
These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious:
  Heat of man's love for man, ardent desires toward beasts.
For those ashamed of him Cupid reserves the bitterest passions,
  Mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse.
But, at the same time, the goddess seeks him, she's watching and list'ning.
  Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be:
Frighten you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting
  Into the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent.
Ah, it's the same with me, too. I haven't escaped her, the goddess.
  Jealously she seeks me out, sweet secret love to expose.
I will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her,
  For, when great lords fall out, I like the Greeks must atone.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
