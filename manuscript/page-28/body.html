<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">god, Jupiter Xenius! Hear:
How I am come to this place I no longer can say—I was
  Seized up by Hebe.  'Twas she led to this sacred hill.
Did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you?
  May be she erred. Then forgive. Let her mistake profit me!
Does not Fortuna, your daughter, when strewing her glorious presents,
  After the manner of girls, yield to each passing whim?
You, O hospitable god, will by no means now banish a stranger
  From your Olympian heights back to the base earth again.
"Poet, come to your senses!"—Forgive me, Jupiter, is not
  Rome's Capitoline Hill second Olympus to you?
Suffer me, Jupiter, here and let Hermes guide me at last then
  Past Cestius' Tomb gently to Orkus below.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
