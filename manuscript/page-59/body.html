Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:
  Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.
None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;
  Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.
Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?
  One can do that if one's young, or if one's lonely enough.
I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:
  During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.
Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set her
  Now by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,
Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,
  Comes to her lover's embrace, where he so eagerly waits.
Luna! Don't rise yet. She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!
  Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.
And as for you, little poems,</blockquote></div> </div>
