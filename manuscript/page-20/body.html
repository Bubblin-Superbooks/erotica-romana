  Than we'd withdraw our hearts from the delights of her cult.
Sweet Opportunity, that is her name. You should meet her.
  Often will she turn up, ever in a new form.
Daughter of Proteus might well she be whom he sired upon Thetis.
  In metamorphoses they've many a hero deceived.
So now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish,
  Teases you while you're asleep; when you awaken, she's flown.
Eagerly yields herself up to the quick, to the active man only.
  He discovers she's tame, playful and tender and sweet.
Once she appeared to me, too: a dark-skinned girl, tumbling
  Over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark.
Round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets;
  Up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair.
When she dashed by me I seized her, mistaking her not. Lovingly
  Kiss and embrace</blockquote></div> </div>
