<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xx</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>While there is many an unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking
  Worse than anything else. Bellowing dogs split my ears.
Nevertheless I do like to hear, and take pleasure in listening
  To the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.
That is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost
  Gave our secret away (when she was visiting me).
Now, when I hear the dog barking I think my beloved is comingâ€”
  Or I remember the time, when long awaited she came.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
