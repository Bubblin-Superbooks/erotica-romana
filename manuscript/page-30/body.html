<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xi</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>Kindling autumnal fire in a rustic, convivial fireplace
  (How the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks!)
Strikes me especially pleasant this evening.  Before all my tinder
  Dies away into coals, coals then to ashes decline,
She will be back and new faggots as well as big logs will be blazing,
  Making a festival where lovers will warm up the night.
Then in the morning, officious, she'll leave the bed of her lover,
  Rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew.
Cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling
  Up from the ashes desire, just when slumber's begun.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
