  Set here in happier years, tended with pleasure today.
You, stand here at my side, good Priapus—albeit from thieves I&#39;ve
  Nothing to fear. Freely pluck, whosoever would eat.
—Hypocrites, those are the ones! If weakened with shame and bad conscience

Bridling at nature&#39;s pure fruit, punish the knave in his hindparts,

Yes, here within thy sanctified walls there&#39;s a soul in each object,

Who will then tell me in whispers and where must I find just the window
  Where one day she&#39;ll be glimpsed: creature who&#39;ll scorch me with love?
Can&#39;t I divine yet the paths through which over and over
  To her and from her I&#39;ll go, squandering valuable time?
Visiting churches and palaces, all of the ruins and the pillars,
  I, a responsible man, profit from making this trip.
With my business accomplished, ah, then shall only one temple,

<p>More than ever I dreamed, I have found it: my happy good fortune!
  Cupid sagaciously led past those palazzos so fine.
He of course knows very well (and I have also discovered)
  What, beneath tapestries rich, gilded boudoirs conceal.
One may if one wishes call him a blind, wanton boy—but I know you,
  Clever Cupid, too well! O, incorruptible god!
We were by no means inveigled to enter fa�ades so majestic;
  Somber cortil� we passed, balcony high and gallant,
Hastening onward until an humble but exquisite portal
  Offered a refuge to both, ardent seeker and guide.
Here he provides me with ev&#39;rything, sees that I get what I call for;
  Each day that passes he spreads freshly plucked roses for me.
—Isn&#39;t that heaven on earth? Say, beautiful Lady Borghese,
  What would you give to me more? —You, Nipotina, what yours?
Banquets and game tables, operas, balls, promenades down the Corso?
  These but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times.
Finery, haughtiness do not entice me. Does one not lift a
  Gown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool?
If she&#39;s to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom,
  Doesn&#39;t he want her to be free from all brooches and chains?
Must not the jewelry, and then the lace and the bustles and whalebone
  All of it come off entire, if he&#39;s to learn how she feels?
I encounter no troubles like those. Simple dress of rough homespun,
  At but a lover&#39;s mere touch, tumbles in folds to the floor.
Quickly he carries the girl as she&#39;s clad in chemise of coarse linen—
  Just as a nursemaid might, playfully up to her bed.
Drapings of satin are absent; the mattress is quite unembroidered.
  Large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two.
Jupiter&#39;s welcome to more from his Juno if he can get it;
  Let any mortal find rest, softer, wherever he can.
We are content with Cupid&#39;s delights, authentic and naked—
  And with the exquisite creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.</p>

&quot;Tell me, was Werther authentic? Did all of that happen in real life?&quot;
  &quot;Lotte, oh where did she live, Werther&#39;s only true love?&quot;
How many times have I cursed those frivolous pages that broadcast
  Out among all mankind passions I felt in my youth!
Were he my brother, why then I &#39;d have murdered poor Werther.
  Yet his despondent ghost couldn&#39;t have sought worse revenge.
That&#39;s the way &quot;Marlborough,&quot; the ditty, follows the Englishman&#39;s travels
  Down to Livorno from France, thence from Livorno to Rome,
All of the way into Naples and then, should he flee on to Madras,

<p>Do not, beloved, regret that you yielded to me so quickly:
  I entertain no base, insolent thoughts about you.
Arrows of Cupid work divers effects. Some do but scratch us:
  Slow and insidious these poison our hearts over years.
Yet with a head freshly honed and cunningly fledged, certain others
  Pierce to the marrow, inflame rapidly there our blood.
When gods and goddesses in days of heroes made love, then
  Lust followed look and desire, with no delay, was indulged.
Surely you don&#39;t think the goddess of love lost a moment reflecting
  When, in Idean grove, Anchises caught her eye.
Nor did Luna delay about kissing that beautiful dreamer—
  Jealous Aurora had else hastily wakened the lad.
At the loud banquet Hero regarded Leander—then promptly
  Into dark waters he plunged, ardently swam toward his love.
When Rhea Silvia, princess and virgin, came down to the Tiber
  Just to fetch water, a god seized her and that is the way
Mars begat himself sons, a pair of twins whom a she wolf

<p>We are so pious, we lovers. Discreetly we worship all powers,
  Hoping for favor from each god and each goddess as well.
We are like you, ye victorious Romans, in this:  for we offer
  Gods of all peoples and tribes, over the whole world, a home—
May the Egyptian, black and austere out of primeval basalt,
  Or from the marble a Greek, form them charming and white—
Yet the eternal ones do not object to particularism
  (Incense of most precious sort, strewn for just one of their host).
Therefore we gladly confess to singling a special immortal
  And our devotions each day pledging but solely to her.
Mischievous celebrants we at these mysteries gay, and so solemn:
  Silence exactly befits rites at which we&#39;re adepts.
Rather onto our heels by horrible deeds the Erinyes
  We would allure, even Zeus&#39; punishment sooner we&#39;d dare—
Under that rock, or bound to a tumbling wheel we&#39;d endure it—
  Than we&#39;d withdraw our hearts from the delights of her cult.
Sweet Opportunity, that is her name. You should meet her.
  Often will she turn up, ever in a new form.
Daughter of Proteus might well she be whom he sired upon Thetis.
  In metamorphoses they&#39;ve many a hero deceived.
So now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish,
  Teases you while you&#39;re asleep; when you awaken, she&#39;s flown.
Eagerly yields herself up to the quick, to the active man only.
  He discovers she&#39;s tame, playful and tender and sweet.
Once she appeared to me, too: a dark-skinned girl, tumbling
  Over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark.
Round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets;
  Up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair.
When she dashed by me I seized her, mistaking her not. Lovingly
  Kiss and embrace she returned, knowing and teaching me how.
O how enraptured I was! Ah, say now no more. It&#39;s a bygone.
  But, O pigtails of Rome, still I&#39;m entrammled in you.</p>

<p>Happily now on classical soil I feel inspiration.

Heeding ancient advice, I leaf through the works of the Ancients
  With an assiduous hand. Daily the pleasure&#39;s renewed.
Throughout the night, in a different way, I&#39;m kept busy by Cupid—
  If erudition is halved, rapture is doubled that way.
Do then I not become wise when I trace with my eye her sweet bosom&#39;s
  Form, and the line of her hips stroke with my hand? I acquire,
As I reflect and compare, my first understanding of marble,
  See with an eye that feels, feel with a hand that sees.
While my beloved, I grant it, deprives me of moments of daylight,
    She in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.
And we do more than just kiss; we prosecute reasoned discussions
  (Should she succumb to sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts).
In her embrace—it&#39;s by no means unusual—I&#39;ve composed poems
  And the hexameter&#39;s beat gently tapped out on her back,
Fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.
  Air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns.
Cupid, while stirring the flame in our lamp, no doubt thinks of those days when
    For the triumvirs he similar service performed.</p>

  Germans speak, I suppose, bitterly when they&#39;re in love.
Bear it I must when the gossips bring forth accusations: I&#39;m guilty—
  Or am I not? But, alas, all of my guilt was with you.
Clothes that you&#39;ve given bear witness for envious neighbors
    That the poor widow no more grieves for her husband alone.
Did you not thoughtlessly visit me in the disguise of a cleric,
    Muffled all up in a cloak, hair all rounded behind?
Who was it chose that gray monk if not you? Well then a prelate
  Now is my lover—Ah, who is my prelate but you?
Never, incredible as it may sound in this clerical city,
  Has any cleric brought me—swear it I will—to his bed.
I was sufficiently poor, sad to say. I was young. The seducers
  Noted it well. Falconier ogled me often enough.
One of the pimps for Albani with billets doux very impressive
  Called me to Ostia once. Quattro Fontani next time.
Who was it did not appear there? Why, who but the very same girl who
  Hated with all of her heart stockings both violet and red.
For: &#39;In the end you poor girls are the ones who are sure to be cheated.&#39;
  So said my father although—Mother was not much impressed.
Father was right. Here I stand in the end being cheated and scolded.
  You don&#39;t believe your own words. They&#39;re your excuse to escape.
Go, then. Unworthy of women are men. We, who carry your children
  Next to our hearts, in these hearts loyalty we bear you, too.
As for you men, when you&#39;ve poured out your potency in our embraces
  And your desires dissipate, love with them passes away.&quot;
These things expressed, and taking her child from its chair, my beloved
  Presses it close to her heart, kisses it, tears in her eyes.
I&#39;m now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted
  Gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent.
For a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it.
  Water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow.
Rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors,

Over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy;

Seeking myself in myself, an unsatisfied spirit, I brooded,

<p>Can&#39;t you hear voices, beloved, out on the Via Flamina?
  Reapers are now going home, back from harvesting grain.
They had journeyed to Rome from afar, and here plaited for Ceres
  Wreaths which the Romans today scorn to make for themselves.
Festivals no longer celebrate Ceres, the nourishing goddess
  Who replaced acorns of old, giving man golden wheat.
Let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private
  (Two constitute a whole tribe, when they are two in love).
Have you by any chance heard how that mystical, strange celebration
  Followed victorious troops back from Eleusis to Rome?
Greeks were the ones who began it, and only to Greeks they proclaimed it
  Even within Roman walls: &quot;Come to the sanctified night.&quot;
Those who were not of the cult kept their distance; neophytes trembled,
  Waiting in garments of white, symbol of all that is pure.
Then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie
  Circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams.
Snakes on the ground were writhing about. Now virgins came bearing
  Caskets securely locked, richly wreath�d with grain.
Surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning—
  Impatient acolytes wait, anxiously hoping for light.
Not until after many a testing and trial did they discover
  What, within sacred ring, secretive image concealed.
What was this mystery other than this:   that Demeter, goddess,
  Once upon a time had to a hero been kind.
It was to Jason, powerful king of the Cretans, she granted
  Of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore.
That made the fortune of Crete! The marital bed of the goddess
  Soon grew pregnant with grain, heavy her bounteous fields.
As for the rest of the world, it languished away, while Ceres,
  Derelict of her true task, dalliance offered in love.
—Now the initiate youths, having followed this tale, all astonished,
  Turned and beckoned their loves—love, do you comprehend?
See there the sacred shade beneath that bushy-boughed myrtle?
  Our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world.</p>

  I recognize it with thanks—life and writings to me.
Lo, I have followed you hither to Rome, and I&#39;d like to do something
  Here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend.
Every traveller I&#39;ve ever known has complained of poor treatment:
  He whom I recommend treatment delicious receives.
You&#39;ve now regarded with awe all the structures which lie here in ruins,
  Cultivated your eye, sensing each hallow�d space.

  Not. Oh come now, admit what I am saying is true.
Where are your own creations, your service to me having slackened?
  Where is invention&#39;s glow now? Where is the color all gone?
Friend, do you hope you can create again? —The school of the Ancients
  Yet remains open.  Its gates, years have not closed them to you.
I am eternally young, and as teacher I still love the young ones.
  Wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not. Listen here:
Wasn&#39;t antiquity young when those fortunate Ancients were living?
  Happy then be your life, too: in it antiquity lives.
Where will you find a fit theme for your song? —It is I must provide it.
  As for a style truly grand, love can alone give you that.&quot;
All of these claims that sophist asserted. Could I contradict him?
  I am wont to obey, when my commander decrees.
Treacherous now he is keeping his word: giving me themes for my poems
  While he is stealing my time, potency, presence of mind.
Gazing into her eyes, holding hands, giving kisses, exchanging
  Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand,
Murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.
  Hymns of such sort pass away, wanting prosodical tact.
Goddess of morning, Aurora, as friend of my muse I once knew you.
  Has the unprincipled god, Cupid, seduced you now too?
So that these mornings you come as his sweetheart, awakening me at
  His festive altar again, where I must celebrate him?
Here on my breast flows her hair, an abundance of curls, while her head rests,
  Pressing my arm as it&#39;s bent, so as to pillow her neck.
What a delicious condition, if only these few tranquil moments
  Could in my memory fix firmly that image of joy
When the night rocked us to sleep—but in slumber she&#39;s moving away now,
  From my side turns, as she goes leaving her hand in my hand.
Love in our hearts makes us one, as the genuine need there stays constant;
  Only returning desire knows oscillation or change.
Gently her hand presses mine, now she opens her eyes and is looking
  Into my own eyes. No—don&#39;t. Let my thoughts rest on your form!
Please close your eyes. They&#39;re inebriation, confusion, they rob me
  All too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords.
Grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member.

Fire-breathing, venomous once, they no longer now depredate our

Think of those ages of gold when Jupiter followed his urges,

It was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred
  Pure when, enamoured, he sought powerful entry to them.
Can you imagine the ragings of Juno if in love&#39;s skirmish
  Poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned?
But we neo-pagans may not after all be abandoned entirely:
  Yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth,
Quick and assiduous. Everyone knows him and ought to adore him,
  Herald of Zeus: Hermes, the healing god.
Although his father&#39;s temple be fallen, and though of its pillars
  Scarcely a pair yet records ancient glory adored,
Nevertheless the son&#39;s place of worship still stands, and forever
  Will there the ardent requests alternate with the thanks.
Only one favor I beg of you, Graces (I ask it in secret—
  Fervent my prayer and deep, out of a passionate breast):
My little garden, my sweet one, protect it and do not let any
  Evil come near it nor me. Cupid will hold out his hand:

  Do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear.</p>

Next to her mother where, frequently shifting her bench, she arranged
  Nicely for me to perceive profile and curve of her neck;
Speaks just a little more loudly than women in Rome are accustomed;
  Significant glance as she pours—misses the glass with the wine
So that it spills on the table, and she with a delicate finger
  Over its surface can draw circles in damp arabesque:
Her name entwining in mine, while my eyes most eagerly follow
  All that her fingertip writes. She is of course well aware
That I am watching, so finally makes the V of the Roman
  Five, with a virgule before. Quickly, as soon as I&#39;ve seen,
She interlaces the circles, reducing them all to ornatest
  Patterns—but still the sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.
I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody
  Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire:
Such a long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting.
  —Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome:
Greater never you&#39;ve nor shall you in future see greater
  Than Rome, O sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold.
Tarry no longer today. Go seek other realms beneath heaven.
  Sooner depart and leave Rome&#39;s seven famed hills to me.
Please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours
  Which the painter devours, eagerly filling his eyes.
Cast now but one ardent glance, while descending, on noble fa�ades and
  Cupolas, pillars, and—last—up at the obelisks. Then
Hastily plunge to the ocean. Come view all the sooner tomorrow
  That which, for centuries now, gods have let you enjoy:
Italy&#39;s shoreline so long overgrown with moist reeds, elevations

First were but few simple dwellings here, suddenly sunlight discovered
  Nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves.
Onto this spot they assembled such plunder, in your eye so splendid
  All earth&#39;s remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note.
You watched a world being born here, watched the same world sink to ruin,
  And from those ruins yet arise world again greater, perhaps.
O may I long by your light now behold this Rome. May the Parc�
  Spin the fine thread of my life slowly, taking great care.
O but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly.
  Wonderful! Sound already the chimes? —No, but I heard at least three.
Thus, my dear muses, again you&#39;ve beguiled the monotony for me.
  Of this long interval while I was apart from my love.

  Gave our secret away (when she was visiting me).
Now, when I hear the dog barking I think my beloved is coming—
  Or I remember the time, when long awaited she came.</p>

<p>I can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others,
  But of a horror besides, thinking of which will arouse
Every fiber in me to revulsion. My friends, I confess it:
  Great displeasure I take lying alone in my bed.
But it&#39;s a horror to fear on the pathways of love you&#39;ll discover
  Snakes and their venom beneath roses of eager desire—
That at the moment supreme, when I&#39;m yielding to pleasure so fully,
  Right at my head as it droops, hissing disease may approach.
That&#39;s why Faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy:
  Loving she always remains faithful, as I am to her.
Young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement;
  I prefer to go slow, savoring pleasures secure.
Is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers,
  Sucking into our lungs, carefree, our partner&#39;s own life?
That is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed. We listen,
  Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain in the wind
Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching
  Blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day.
Quirites, permit me the joy, and may this, of all pleasures on earth the
  First and the last, be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.</p>

<p>Ah, to uphold one&#39;s respectable name is not easy. The Lady
  Fame has an ancient foe: Cupid, my master and lord.
Oh, by the way, have you heard of the cause of their mutual hatred?
  It&#39;s an old story, I think—Let me just tell it again.
Powerful ever the goddess, but nevertheless to her fellows
  Overbearing and rude, quite unendurable. She
Had by the gods since time out of mind at their banquets been dreaded,
  Yelling with brassiest voice orders to great and to small.
Once, in her arrogance even maintained that she had subjected
  To her own will, as her slave, Jove&#39;s most illustrious son.
&quot;One of these days, O father of deities,&quot; cried she in triumph,
  &quot;I shall be bringing you my—Hercules, as if new born.
Don&#39;t think that Hercules be still that boy whom Alcmene once bore you;
  His adulation of me makes him now god upon earth.
When toward Olympus he gazes, I&#39;ve no doubt you hope that he&#39;s looking
  Piously toward your knees. Hardly. He&#39;s looking for me.
Worthiest man! O the vision of winning my favor makes easy
  Hitherto unexplored paths, under that powerful foot.
I do my part, for I meet him halfway and proclaim his adventures
  Praising his name in advance, even before he&#39;s begun.
One day you&#39;ll wed me to Hercules.  Hero who Amazons conquered
  That day will overwhelm me. Happily I&#39;ll call him:  spouse.&quot;
All of the gods kept their counsel, and none would reply to the braggart,
  Lest in a pique she devise vengeance against one of them.
Cupid, escaping attention, slipped off to enslave, however, her hero:
  Artlessly conquering by—force of a beautiful girl,
Afterward decked out his couple in mute masquerade:  lionskin
  Over her shoulders, the club leaned (by much toil) at her side;
Wiry stiff hair of the hero larded with blossoms, a distaff
  Laid in his fist, to conform strength to the dalliance of love.
Scene now completed and ready to tease, he goes scampering, shouting
  For all Olympus to hear: &quot;Come, see these glorious deeds!
Heaven and Earth and the Sun on his indefatigable journey
  Over that infinite path never did witness the like!&quot;
Everyone hastened, gulled by the dissolute boy, who feigning
  Earnest, had summoned them all (Fame by no means lagged behind).
Which of the gods will now smile in sweet condescension on Cupid?
  —Juno! delighted, of course, seeing a man humbled so.
Fame, on the other hand, stood there ashamed, embarrassed, despairing.
  First she just laughed, saying: &quot;Gods, be not deceived. It&#39;s a masque.
I know my hero too well to be fooled by disguises of actors.&quot;
  Soon, though, in pain she perceived: Hercules, none but he.
(Vulcan had not been one thousandth so vexed to discover his playmate
  Under his meshes ensnared, caught with his own lusty friend,
Lying just as the wiles of the net at the most crucial moment
  Deftly embraced their embrace, trapping their instant of joy.
How those boys, Bacchus and Mercury, guffawed, and freely admitted:
  Sweet must be the repose, lying on bosom so fine
Of this magnificent woman. They turned to Vulcan entreating:
  &quot;Do not release them just yet. Let us inspect them once more.&quot;
And the old cuckold was cuckold enough to comply with their wishes.)
  As for poor Fame, in all haste, burning with wrath she must flee.
Since then no armistice has been proclaimed to the feuding between them.
  Let her but favor a man, hot in pursuit is the boy.
He whom Fame honors most can least defend against Cupid,
  And her most dang&#39;rous attacks strike the most morally proud.
Whoever tries to escape him is dragged down from bad deeds to worse ones.
  Yes, he will offer you girls—if like a fool you despise
These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious:
  Heat of man&#39;s love for man, ardent desires toward beasts.
For those ashamed of him Cupid reserves the bitterest passions,
  Mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse.
But, at the same time, the goddess seeks him, she&#39;s watching and list&#39;ning.
  Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be:
Frighten you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting
  Into the worst of repute houses he&#39;s known to frequent.
Ah, it&#39;s the same with me, too. I haven&#39;t escaped her, the goddess.
  Jealously she seeks me out, sweet secret love to expose.
I will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her,
  For, when great lords fall out, I like the Greeks must atone.</p>

<p>However comely be strength, or free and undaunted comportment,
  Secrecy is for a man most important of all.
Mighty subduer of cities, Discretion, O princess of nations,
  Goddess whom I adore, safely you&#39;ve led me thus far.
Now, though, what fate shall befall me? My frivolous muse has now opened
  —Cupid, the scamp—opens lips hitherto sealed so well.
Difficult is it, alas, to conceal the shame of a monarch;
  Hide it can neither his crown, nor a tight Phrygian cap:
Midas has asses ears! the first servant discovers—O horror!
  Shame of this secret so weighs, Midas unburdens his heart.
Into the earth for safekeeping the servant must bury the story,
  Easing in this way the king:  earth must conceal the tale.
Reeds in a trice are sprouting and rustling in murmuring breezes:
  &quot;Midas, o Midas the King—bears the ears of an ass!&quot;
Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:
  Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.
None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;
  Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.
Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?
  One can do that if one&#39;s young, or if one&#39;s lonely enough.
I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:
  During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.
Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set her
  Now by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,
Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,
  Comes to her lover&#39;s embrace, where he so eagerly waits.
Luna! Don&#39;t rise yet. She&#39;s coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!
  Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.
And as for you, little poems, o grow and flower, your blossoms
  Cradling themselves in the air, tepid and soft with love&#39;s breath.
Wafting, betray to Quirites, as Midas&#39; reeds did with cheap gossip,
  One happy couple in love, and their sweet secret, at last.</p>

<p>I in the back of the garden, the last of the gods, in a corner,
  Ineptly formed, must I stand. Evil the inroads of time.
Cucumber vines grow entwining about this primeval lingam,
  Cracking it almost in two under the weight of the fruit.
Faggots are heaped all about me against the cold of the winter,
  Which I so hate for the crows settling then down on my head,
Which they befoul very shamefully. Summer&#39;s no better: the servants
  Empty their bowels and show insolent, naked behinds.
Filth, above and below! I was clearly in danger of turning
  Into filth myself, toadstool, rotten wood!
Now, by your efforts, O noblest of artists, I shall recover
  With fellow gods my just place. And it&#39;s no more than my due.
Jupiter&#39;s throne, so dishonestly won, it was I who secured it:
  Color and ivory, marble and bronze, not to mention the poems.
Now, all intelligent men look upon me in kindness. They like to
  Form their own image of me, just as the poet has done.
Nor do the girls take offense when they see me—by no means the matrons.
  None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.
Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)
  Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,
Nor shall your member grow weary until you&#39;ve enjoyed the full dozen
  Artful positions the great poet Philainis describes.</p>

<h4 id="about-the-elegies">ABOUT THE ELEGIES</h4>
<p>Goethe cultivated a special, italianate hand for this portfolio of twenty-four &quot;elegies,&quot; so called because he was emulating the elegiasts of Imperial Rome, Tibullus, Propertius, Catullus. The Elegies have never before been published as here, together in the cyclical form of their original conception. Experts even denied that the two priapeia (I &amp; XXIV) were by Goethe at all, although they are in the same hand as the rest. To be sure, these two are not numbered, so that I was long undecided as to just what their proper position might be. At one time I imagined they must belong at the middle of the cycle where at the end of Elegy XIII Priapus&#39; mother summons her son. Obviously Goethe, just returned north from his two years in Italy (1786-88), and alienated from prim, courtly friends (especially since he had taken a girlfriend into his cottage), had no thought of publication when he indited these remembrances of Ancient Rome. But he did show them to close friends, one of whom was the wonderful dramatist Friedrich Schiller. In 1795, Schiller undertook a new periodical, Die Horen. This thoughtful and responsible man initiated the journal with an essay of his own, explaining how forms of entertainment are actually at the same time our primary modes of education. It makes for pretty difficult reading in our present, less interested epoch. But he did break the essay up with diversions solicited from the best minds of his era. For a discussion of all this, see</p>
<p><em>Professor Worthy&#39;s Page</em></p>
<p>For now, it is enough to say that among Schiller&#39;s examples for &quot;aesthetic education,&quot; as he called it, were these Elegies by his much admired friend, Wolfgang Goethe. Editor and author made substantial changes for propriety&#39;s sake—despite Goethe&#39;s having lashed out to the contrary in the first Elegy (which he now suppressed, along with the final one). My attempt has been—for the very first time by the way, in any language—to restore Goethe&#39;s cycle to his early conception. Since I have been unwilling to intrude with learned notes, I must apologize for Goethe&#39;s many classical allusions, which were as familiar to his own readership as are, in our publications today, the dense references to media celebrities. Modern editors of what they call the &quot;Roman Elegies&quot; bring abundant annotation, and often detail Goethe&#39;s own emendations. What I bring here is merely translated from his manuscript in the Goethe-Schiller Archive in Weimar.</p>
